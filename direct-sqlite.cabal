synopsis: Low-level binding to SQLite3.  Includes UTF8 and BLOB support.
Cabal-version: >= 1.10
Build-type: Simple
description:
  This package is not very different from the other SQLite3 bindings out
  there, but it fixes a few deficiencies I was finding.  As compared to
  bindings-sqlite3, it is slightly higher-level, in that it supports
  marshalling of data values to and from the database.  In particular, it
  supports strings encoded as UTF8, and BLOBs represented as ByteStrings.
  .
  Release history:
  .
  [Version 2.3.3.1] Upgrade bundled SQLite3 to 3.7.15.2.
  .
  [Version 2.3.3] Add trace support, as a feature for debugging.
  .
  [Version 2.3.2] Add execPrint, execWithCallback, and interruptibly functions.
  Add bindings for sqlite3_last_insert_rowid and sqlite3_changes.  Change the
  Show instance of the Utf8 newtype to better match the IsString instance.
  .
  [Version 2.3.1] Upgrade the bundled SQLite3 to 3.7.15.  Add bindings for
  sqlite3_interrupt.  Export Int rather than CInt.
  .
  [Version 2.3] Mark some FFI calls "unsafe", for a substantial performance
  benefit.
  .
  [Version 2.2.1] Bump down text library version to match with the
  latest Haskell Platform.
  .
  [Version 2.2] actually does what version 2.1 claimed to, since the author
  made a mistake with git.
  .
  [Version 2.1] improves handling of invalid UTF-8 and changes error handling
  to be more complete.  It also adds a build flag to build against the system
  sqlite instead of the bundled one, optionally (disabled by default).
  .
  [Version 2.0] uses Text for strings instead of String.
  .
  [Version 1.1.0.1] switches to the Faction packaging system and makes no other
  changes.
  .
  [Version 1.1] adds the SQLite amalgamation file (version 3.7.5) to the
  project, so that there are no external dependencies.
