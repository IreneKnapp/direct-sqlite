synopsis: Low-level binding to SQLite3.  Includes UTF8 and BLOB support.
Cabal-version: >= 1.10
Build-type: Simple
description:
  This package is not very different from the other SQLite3 bindings out there, but
  it fixes a few deficiencies I was finding.  It is not as complete as bindings-sqlite3,
  but is slightly higher-level, in that it supports marshalling of data values to and
  from the database.  In particular, it supports strings encoded as UTF8, and BLOBs
  represented as ByteStrings.
  .
  Release history:
  .
  [2.0] uses Text for strings instead of String.
  .
  [1.1.0.1] switches to the Faction packaging system and makes no other
  changes.
  .
  [1.1] adds the SQLite amalgamation file (version 3.7.5) to the project, so that
  there are no external dependencies.
